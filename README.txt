== Description ==

This simple plugin lets you embed <a href="http://tentblogger.com/adsense/">Google Adsense</a> code into strategic locations in your blog posts to maximize profit.

Strategic placement of your <a href="http://tentblogger.com/adsense/">Google Adsense</a> in your WordPress-powered blog is crucial to your success and there appears to be patterns of success that have worked for many bloggers.

Namely, the Blogger's <a href="http://tentblogger.com/adsense-combo/">Adsense Combo</a> is one that historically works - placing your Adsense before the content and between the content layer and engagement layer.

This plugin allows you to do that well and even allows you to show Google Adsense on a time-delay basis. For example, you can show the Adsense a few days after the post goes live so you can reward your daily readers and then maximize profit through <a href="http://tentblogger.com/organic-traffic/">organic returns</a>, which is the <a href="http://tentblogger.com/organic-traffic/">most-high source</a> of Google Adsense earnings.

Super simple to use and implement!
